# Variational Autoencoder
- A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that is widely used in unsupervised   
  machine  learning. Unlike traditional autoencoders, which are designed for tasks like dimensionality reduction and  feature learning, VAEs are capable of generating new data samples that are similar to those in the training set. This is achieved by learning a probabilistic latent space, which encodes the distribution of the training data in a lower-dimensional space.
